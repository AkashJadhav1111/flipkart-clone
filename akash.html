        <b> Verse 1:
            My name is Akash, I'm a full stack dev
            I build websites from scratch, from concept to deploy
            HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I know it all
            I'm a master of the code, and I stand tall

            Chorus:
            I'm a full stack web developer, on top of my game
            I create websites that are never the same
            I bring ideas to life, and make them shine
            I'm a coding genius, one of a kind

            Verse 2:
            From front-end to back-end, I handle it all
            I create responsive sites, that look great on mobile
            Node.js, React, and MongoDB, I work with ease
            I'm a tech wizard, and my skills never freeze

            Chorus:
            I'm a full stack web developer, on top of my game
            I create websites that are never the same
            I bring ideas to life, and make them shine
            I'm a coding genius, one of a kind

            Outro:
            Akash, keep up the great work, keep building with pride
